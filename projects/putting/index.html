        This project implements a low-profile optical measurement system designed to quantify two critical parameters
        of a putting stroke: initial start line and launch speed. The goal was to provide immediate, objective feedback
        without relying on club-mounted sensors or altering ball roll characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system uses two infrared sensing gates positioned at fixed distances in front of the ball. Multiple
        break-beam sensors within each gate detect lateral crossing order and timestamp ball passage. Launch angle is
        estimated from left/right crossing order, while time-of-flight between gates is used to compute initial ball
        speed. An embedded microcontroller timestamps events at kilohertz-scale resolution and evaluates results
        against configurable tolerances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Design constraints emphasized deterministic timing, low latency feedback, and ease of use. The hardware was
        kept under 25&nbsp;mm in height to avoid influencing roll, while firmware was structured to deliver feedback
        within sub-200&nbsp;ms end-to-end latency. Verification included angle-board testing, ramp-based speed
        validation, and repeated setup trials to confirm accuracy, responsiveness, and usability. The resulting system
        demonstrates repeatable measurement performance and a firmware architecture suitable for extension to
        additional metrics or wireless data logging.
