      <h3>RV32I Single-Cycle CPU Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        This project involved the design and implementation of a modular RV32I single-cycle processor with a clear
        separation between datapath and control logic. The objective was to build a correct, extensible baseline
        architecture that emphasizes clean interfaces, deterministic control, and verifiable behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        The processor datapath was architected to support instruction fetch, decode, execution, and writeback, with
        dedicated control logic for opcode decoding, immediate generation, and ALU operation selection. Particular
        attention was given to ALU condition flags, branch evaluation, and precise control signal timing. Functional
        correctness was validated using unit and integration testbenches, with waveform analysis serving as the primary
        debugging and verification tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key challenges included handling signed arithmetic edge cases such as overflow and borrow propagation while
        preserving stable module interfaces. These issues were resolved through disciplined signal timing analysis and
        iterative verification. The final design passes all test cases and provides a clean architectural foundation for
        future extensions such as pipelining, memory-mapped peripherals, or multi-cycle execution without breaking
        existing module contracts.
